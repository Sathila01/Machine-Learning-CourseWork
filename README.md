# Machine-Learning-CourseWork
This is a simple classification problem of labelling emails as
spam or non-spam, based on their content in terms of words. The dataset is taken
from UCI Machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase).
This is achieved using two machine learning models based on K Nearest Neighbors
(KNN) and Decision Trees.
